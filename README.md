## Project Title

Fuel Consumption & Cost Analysis for Transport Fleet

## Description

This project analyzes fuel consumption and cost patterns across a transport fleet to identify inefficiencies and recommend cost-optimization strategies.

## Tools Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

## Key Analysis

Fuel consumption by vehicle type

City-wise fuel cost comparison

Fuel efficiency calculations

High-cost vehicle identification

## Key Insights

Fuel efficiency varies significantly between vehicles.

Some cities incur higher fuel costs due to longer routes and traffic congestion.

A small number of vehicles contribute disproportionately to fuel expenses.

## Recommendations

Regular maintenance for low-efficiency vehicles.

Driver training for fuel-efficient driving.

Continuous monitoring of fuel usage.
